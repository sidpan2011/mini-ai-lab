# AI Usage Summary

**AI Tool:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)  
**Role:** Development accelerator under human direction  
**Approach:** Human-led implementation with selective AI assistance  

---

## Overview

AI was used as a **pair-programming assistant** to speed up repetitive or boilerplate work, suggest architecture patterns, and help debug complex issues.  
All core logic, architecture, and implementation decisions were **human-led, reviewed, and validated** through manual testing.

## Key Areas of Assistance

| Area | AI Assisted With | Human Responsibility |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Planning & Setup** | Suggested folder structure, Next.js + Jest configuration | Final architecture and library choices |
| **Authentication** | Generated form components, validation schemas, and JWT logic drafts | Integrated APIs, fixed loader bug, finalized UX |
| **Image Generation Studio** | Created initial UI and API hooks | Implemented state management, error handling, and integration |
| **API Layer** | Drafted fetch wrappers and TypeScript types | Connected with backend, handled auth and error flows |
| **Testing** | Provided Jest/MSW setup and test skeletons | Designed test strategy, validated coverage and reliability |
| **Documentation & CI/CD** | Generated base markdowns, GitHub workflows | Edited, validated, and finalized all content |

## Human Ownership

- Designed **application architecture** and **data flow**  
- Directed feature scope and component structure  
- Implemented and debugged **auth persistence**, **upload flow**, and **API integration**  
- Performed all **manual testing** and **code reviews**  
- Finalized **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **CI/CD pipeline** setups  

---

## Quality Assurance

- **Test Coverage:** 91%+  
- **Verification:** Manual + automated  
- **Review:** 100% human validation before merge  
- **Tools Used:** Jest, React Testing Library, MSW, Playwright  

---

## Transparency Statement

AI was used responsibly as a **supportive tool**, not as an autonomous developer.  
Every piece of AI-assisted code was reviewed, tested, and modified before integration.  
Critical logic, debugging, and architectural decisions were fully human-led.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates **efficient human–AI collaboration**:  
AI accelerated development; human expertise ensured correctness, maintainability, and quality.  
The final system reflects **human engineering judgment**, with AI used purely as an amplifier of productivity.
